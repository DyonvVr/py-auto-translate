# CONFIGURATION

# Which provider to use for translation.

# translations. This is free, but may result in a temporary IP ban if quota are exceeded.
# Option "google_cloud" uses Google Cloud Platform for translations. Requires setting up a GCP
# account and an AutoML project. User is responsible for the costs of using GCP.
# Option "bing" uses HTTP requests to https://www.bing.com/translator. Free, but may result
# in a temporary IP ban.
